# Backlog

A collection of user stories you can choose from. Stories inside each priority
level are not necessarily in order, it's up to your group to decide how they fit
into your strategy. These are also just suggestions, feel free to change them or
create your own!

## Must-Haves

> These are necessary for basic usability.

- [ ] **As a recruiter**, I want to see a clear navigation bar so that I can
      easily explore different sections of the portfolio.
  - _Given I land on the website, when I use the navigation bar, then I should
    be able to access Home, About, Skills, Portfolio, and Contact sections._
- [ ] **As a visitor**, I want to view detailed project descriptions and links
      so that I can understand the developer's work.

  - _Given I click on a project in the Portfolio section, when the project
    opens, then I should see a live demo or a repository link._

- [ ] **As a potential client**, I want to fill out a contact form so that I can
      reach out to the developer easily.
  - _Given I visit the Contact section, when I submit the form, then my message
    should be sent to the developer._

## Should-Haves

> These will complete the user experience but are not necessary.

- [ ] **As a visitor**, I want the website to be mobile-friendly so that I can
      view it easily on my phone.

  - _Given I open the website on a mobile device, when I navigate through it,
    then all sections should be responsive and easy to use._

- [ ] **As a fellow developer**, I want to see the technologies used in each
      project so that I can evaluate the developer's technical skills.
  - _Given I check the Portfolio section, when I view a project, then I should
    see a list of technologies/tools used._

## Could-Haves

> Would be really cool ... if there's time.

- [ ] **As a visitor**, I want to download the developer's CV so that I can
      review their qualifications offline.

  > - _Given I visit the About section, when I click the download button, then
  >   the CV should download as a PDF._

- [ ] **As a visitor**, I want animations or transitions to make the site more
      engaging so that I have a better browsing experience.

  > - _Given I navigate through the site, when I move between sections or
  >   interact with elements, then animations should enhance the experience._
